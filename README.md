# ASM-char-in-VHDL

The ASM (Algorithmic State Machine) chart can be implemented on any FPGA, offering the opportunity to realize various mathematical functions and applications. In this project, I implemented a reference ASM chart and tested it using a test bench. Documentation is provided below for further details.

These components were tested using a test bench in Xilinx Vivado. Additionally, the ASM chart diagram is available on LinkedIn.
